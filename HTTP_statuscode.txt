Hereâ€™s a list of the **HTTP status codes** you've mentioned, with their meanings:

---

### **2xx - Success**
- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server has sent back the requested data.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and as a result, a new resource was created (typically used for POST requests).
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but the server has no data to send in the response. Often used for DELETE operations.
- **206 Partial Content**: The server is returning only part of the resource, typically in response to a request for a range of data (e.g., downloading a large file in chunks).

---

### **3xx - Redirection**
- **301 Moved Permanently**: The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL. All future requests should be directed to the new URL.
- **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not been modified since the last request. The client can use its cached version of the resource.
- **307 Temporary Redirect**: The resource has been temporarily moved to a new URL, and future requests should still use the original URL.
- **308 Permanent Redirect**: Similar to 301, but the method and body of the request must not be changed when redirected. This is a permanent redirect, and future requests should use the new URL.

### **4xx - Client Errors**
- **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot process the request due to a malformed or invalid request.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The request requires user authentication, and the user has not been authenticated or the provided credentials are incorrect.
- **402 Payment Required**: This code is reserved for future use and is currently not widely used. It was originally intended for payment processing.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it. The client does not have permission to access the requested resource.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
- **408 Request Timeout**: The server timed out while waiting for the client to send a request. This could happen if the client takes too long to send the data.
- **413 Payload Too Large**: The request is too large for the server to process.
- **414 URI Too Long**: The URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) provided in the request is too long for the server to handle.
- **415 Unsupported Media Type**: The server does not support the media type of the request payload. This often happens when the client sends a file type the server cannot process.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: The client has sent too many requests in a given period of time. The server is limiting the rate of requests (often used for rate-limiting).

---

### **5xx - Server Errors**
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **501 Not Implemented**: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. For example, it might not support the requested HTTP method.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is temporarily unavailable, typically due to being overloaded or undergoing maintenance.
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server or resource.

---

### Summary:
- **2xx codes** represent successful responses.
- **3xx codes** are related to redirects.
- **4xx codes** indicate client-side errors (the problem is with the request).
- **5xx codes** represent server-side errors (the problem is on the server).
